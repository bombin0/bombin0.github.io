      <h3>Reaction Time testing device</h3>
    </section>
    <!-- main content -->
    <article class="three_third">
      <h2>Overview:</h2>
      <p>I am passionate about finding solutions to everyday problems that we face day to day. My ideal IT innovation would be something that helps many people by making their lives easier and safer.<br> <br>A project that requires a variety of skills and resourcefulness while also being fun and helpful to people is a reaction time tester device. This reaction tester is an Arduino project that uses basic components and relatively technical code to test one’s reaction time. It works by having the player press a button as soon as an LED changes colours and then displays the time taken between the light change and the button press. It is a relatively simple concept but not so simple in design.</p>

            <h2>Motivation:</h2>
            <p>This device will be useful for people that may be unaware of how fast alcohol can affect your senses and driving ability. Research by the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) has found that a blood alcohol content as low as 0.04 is enough to impair one’s perception while driving.<br> <br>The device will be able to test three aspects that all have to do with car safety and driving responsibly. First it will test ‘decision time’ by flashing different colours to throw the player off and requiring the player to make the correct decision when the right colour flashes. Secondly it will ‘test reaction’ time by counting how long it takes for the player to react to the correct colour flash. Finally, it will test ‘resistance to distraction’ by alternating colours but also by having a short beep sound playing occasionally between colour changes to distract the player.</p>

                  <h2>Description:</h2>
                  <p>The features of this project include; LEDs that are set to flash at random timings and intervals, button that is to be pressed by the players when the correct light flashes and a screen that displays the time taken to press the button.</p>

                          <li>Arduino microcontroller</li>
                          <li>Arduino code editor</li>
                          <li>1 RGB LED or three separate ones.</li>
                          <li>4 resistors (220 ohm)</li>
                          <li>LCD display</li>
                          <li>Piezo Speaker</li>

                      <article class="three_third">
                        <h2>Skills Required:</h2>
                        <p>Technical skills are required such as using a beadboard and putting together a circuit. But also, skills like Arduino coding and software development are also required to create the random timings of the LEDs and to set off the speaker to create the beep sound. I also might need to put together a custom box to house the components of the project and in doing so it will require some basic engineering skills.</p>

                            <p>If this project is successful then I will be able to have a bit of fun with my friends during a night out initially but also have the results be confronting towards the end of the night. Hopefully this device may help to change the minds of my friends that may think they are sober enough to get behind the wheel of a car.</p>
